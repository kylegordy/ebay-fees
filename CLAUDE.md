## Git

- **IMPORTANT: NEVER commit without explicit user approval.** Whenever you would want to commit, instead stage the changes and show the proposed commit message, stopping just short of committing. Wait for the user to confirm before running `git commit`.
- Pull first, stage files, show proposed message, wait for approval
- **"prep"** triggers the above
- Commit message: focus on **why**, not what
- Attribution: blank line + `In partnership with Claude Code`
- One unit of work per commit
